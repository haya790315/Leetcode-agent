    Context manager for Playwright that handles cleanup automatically.

    This implements the Context Manager Protocol (__enter__ and __exit__).
    It ensures that browser resources are always properly cleaned up,

    Usage:
        with PlaywrightManager("https://example.com") as (playwright, browser, context, page):
            # Use page here - this is where you do your actual work

            page.screenshot(path="screenshot.png")
        # Everything is automatically cleaned up here

    Benefits:
        - No memory leaks from unclosed browsers
        - No zombie browser processes
        - Exception-safe resource management
